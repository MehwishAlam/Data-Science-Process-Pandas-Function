# Data-Science-Process-Pandas-Function
A comprehensive project encompassing the data science workflow—from collection and cleaning through modeling and deployment—using fundamental pandas functions for data manipulation, inspection, and analysis


Data Science Process
Description: This code outlines the essential steps in the data science workflow. It typically includes:

Data Collection:
Gathering raw data from various sources.
Example: Collecting data on daily temperatures from a weather API.

Data Cleaning:
Removing or correcting inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data.
Example: Fixing missing values or correcting typos in a dataset of customer names.

Feature Engineering:
Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Example: Adding a "day of the week" feature to predict sales based on whether it's a weekend or weekday.

Data Visualization:
Creating charts or graphs to visually represent data and reveal patterns.
Example: Using a bar chart to show the distribution of sales across different product categories.

Model Building:
Developing a mathematical model to make predictions or classify data.
Example: Training a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and number of bedrooms.
Statistical Inference:

Using statistical methods to make conclusions or decisions about the data.
Example: Conducting a t-test to determine if the difference in average sales between two stores is statistically significant.

Error Diagnosis:
Identifying and analyzing errors in model predictions to improve accuracy.
Example: Reviewing residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) to identify patterns in prediction errors.

Dashboarding:
Creating interactive visual displays to present and explore data insights.
Example: Building a dashboard with graphs and filters to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for a business.


Basic Pandas Functions
Description: This code provides fundamental pandas functions used for data manipulation and analysis. It includes:

DataFrame Creation: Constructing DataFrames from various data sources.
Reading/Writing Data: Importing data from files (e.g., CSV, Excel) and exporting DataFrames to files.
Data Inspection: Inspecting the structure and summary statistics of the DataFrame.
Data Selection and Filtering: Accessing and filtering data using labels and integer positions.
Data Manipulation: Modifying DataFrame content by dropping, renaming, or filling missing values.
Data Aggregation: Grouping and summarizing data to derive insights.
Sorting and Combining: Sorting data and combining multiple DataFrames for comprehensive analysis.
These descriptions should give a concise overview of the key aspects covered in each code segment.
