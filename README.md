# Data-Science-Process-Pandas-Function
A comprehensive project encompassing the data science workflow—from collection and cleaning through modeling and deployment—using fundamental pandas functions for data manipulation, inspection, and analysis


Data Science Process
Description: This code outlines the essential steps in the data science workflow. It typically includes:

Data Collection: Gathering raw data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using statistical and graphical methods.
Modeling: Applying machine learning algorithms to build predictive models or perform statistical inference.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics and validation techniques.
Deployment: Implementing the model in a real-world scenario and monitoring its performance.
Dashboarding: Creating visualizations and reports to communicate findings and results effectively.


Basic Pandas Functions
Description: This code provides fundamental pandas functions used for data manipulation and analysis. It includes:

DataFrame Creation: Constructing DataFrames from various data sources.
Reading/Writing Data: Importing data from files (e.g., CSV, Excel) and exporting DataFrames to files.
Data Inspection: Inspecting the structure and summary statistics of the DataFrame.
Data Selection and Filtering: Accessing and filtering data using labels and integer positions.
Data Manipulation: Modifying DataFrame content by dropping, renaming, or filling missing values.
Data Aggregation: Grouping and summarizing data to derive insights.
Sorting and Combining: Sorting data and combining multiple DataFrames for comprehensive analysis.
These descriptions should give a concise overview of the key aspects covered in each code segment.
